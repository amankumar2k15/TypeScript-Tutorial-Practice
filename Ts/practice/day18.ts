// We want to create a function that formats the value passed to it in a specific way based on its type:
// if the input is a number, it should add a dollar sign and format it with two decimal places.
// if the input is a boolean, it should return "Yes" for true and "No" for false.
// if the input is a string, it should capitalize the first letter.











//// Combine User and Account Data
//  You are building a user management system, and you have two typeScript types:
// User : Represents basic user information, with the following properties:
// id (number): The user's unique identifier.
// name (string): The user's name
// email (string): the user's email address.

// Account : Contains detils about the user's account, with the folloowing
// accountId (number): The account's unique identifier.
// accountType (string): The type of the account (e.g., "Savings", "Checking" etc.)
// balance (number): The account balance.

// Your task is to create a function called combineUserAndAccount that takes a User object and an Account object as arguments and returns a new object  respresenting the combined information of the user and their account.

// Ensure that the resulting object contains all the properties from both User and Account types.
